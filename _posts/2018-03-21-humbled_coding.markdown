I was working on a few classes. Really simple, and especially familiar to students: create a song class, have it play nicely with an artist class, and make them play nicely with an mp3 importer class. I understand classes. Sure. Suddenly I was working with more than class structure though. Regex? Files... I mean, it's something vital and common but I had never used Ruby to grab a file, let alone a list of files based on if they were .mp3. Ok, things are getting a bit complicated.
  So, back to basics. Google, my friend, I need some help. Google, my friend, that didn't help very much. Ok, you're right, I was asking the wrong questions. Oh, what's this? I found the github listing of students who have excelled at this lesson prior to myself. Well, ok...it's their code. I don't want to cheat, because I will just cheat myself. However, I was curious how other people tackled the same issues I tackled. 
	 I scoured countless entries. It became clear to me that there was a trend of others who had found the same source. The code looked... oddly similar in some parts. Namely, the parts that blew my dang mind. At first glance, I thought, "WHOA! I not only have never seen THAT method, but I can't even figure it out!". It became clear some students were cheating off a few very talented/well-informed students. Meh. Still, those "contributors" were undeniably helpful. 
	 It was very humbling to see my old lessons using extra fluff if/else statements, when many others were one-liners with ternary (x ? y : z) statements. Another similar example: 
	 
	 if statement_is_true
	   do_something
		else
		  do_nothing
		end

  This was elegantly handled by others simply writing: 
			
			if statement_true do_something
			
  One line and still cleaner than mine. Ugh! I went from curiosity to eager learning. It opened a whole new world: seeing others code could be used for something so much more important than "cheating". I never wanted to cheat in the first place...which is easy to say when one is as prideful and stubborn as myself. I want to do it. I think that stubbornness to do things on my own had been holding me back.
			What do I mean? Well, I've been progressing through the course...even helping others at various times. However, I rarely asked for help and NEVER sought to collaborate with others on my current progress. Helping others on lessons in my past is not collaborative learning (for me). I never attended any study sessions. I never joined in on any live lectures. I was limiting myself to pride and the limited perspective of me. I will strive to participate with others more, because apparently, other people have some pretty great ideas. Go figure.
