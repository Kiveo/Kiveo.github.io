When life slows down from a high speed, high stress stress month, we tend to settle into ourselves. We take a moment to relax and think about all the little things we had to put on hold, as we rushed to meet a deadline or deal with the chaos of life. The dust has settled. Now, time to get back to coding. Where to begin? A symptom of being a habitual learner, I am always tempted to learn something new. When, really, I ought to further hone the skills I've worked so hard to gain in the last year. Thus, I begin to wonder: what can I do that allows me to learn but also strengthen a skill? Learning Python was a tempting choice. I could learn a new language and continue my coding skillset. However, that, I decided, was too broad. Furthermore, it would be prudent to stick to ruby or javascript for the time being...it is what is on my resume afterall. 
<p>So, I brew a cup of coffee and brainstorm some good dual purpose undertakings. The following is the list I came up with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upload a past project to the internet to gain familiarity with Heroku and the deployment process</li>
	<li>Create a project using Test Driven Development(TDD) and further my understanding of RSpec</li>
	<li>Reformat an older project's page using a popular framework: such as Bootstrap, React JS, or SASS.</li>
	<li>Take over control of my blog by looking into (and possibly blogging about) github pages and Jekyll.</li>
	<li>Further develop and refine past projects, adding polish and necessary refactoring</li>
</ul>

<p>The list was augmented to exclude things like "learn xyz programming language" or "create an enterprise level app, xyz". Those projects would be too large, time consuming, and would not hone my full stack skill set as quickly as the current list. More importantly, I need tasks that are relatively manageable while working, seeking a job, and attempting to have a family/social life.</p>

<p>After several cups of coffee, and a long night, I checked off the first item. It was refreshing to begin a day feeling intimidated by the Heroku environment, then the next day feel secure and proud that a past school project was officially live and online. There were some hiccups, but it was satisfying. Looking back, it is something I wish I had done earlier in my coding career, but now certainly beats later. The next few days roll around.</p>

<p>I have obligations. I do not get to code nearly as much as I desired. Frustrating. Coffee, sans code. However, things settle again and I get back to it. I spend a couple evenings working out a project/pipeline with a developer friend. I also spend an evening describing React and Redux to a php dev. That was fun! It was a good refresher for myself too. It wasn't on the list, but it certainly fulfilled the purpose of a list item. Time continues, more coffee is consumed.</p>

<p>I've begun coding a rails app solely to get more practice using the gem 'rspec'. TDD seems like a wonderful habit to get myself more into. I've seen a lot of Rspec. More than I care to think about, honestly. I think every Flatiron graduate has, to be fair. That said, as with most things in life, doing something out of self motivation really lends to deeper learning. Despite having running #rspec thousands of times, I had not actually written thousands of test code lines. I had not written hundreds of lines of test code either. I decided to change that. The project is still a work in progress. As a note for using 'rspec', it is apparently self referenced as RSpec, *not* Rspec. Hadn't really noticed that until I was writing the files from scratch. Something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>A different day, and a different coffee flavor, I set about reformatting some CSS on one of my web apps. I redid the entire aesthetic. Good practice. I showed my wife, and she said "I like it better than the old version." I, however, did not. I reverted it back, frustratingly. Next time, I will use bootstrap to emulate my hand code. I was able to successfully convert some portions to css Flexbox though, which was nice and something I actually kept.</p>

<p>I did some research into my blog as well. As it turns out, it is getting auto formatted by github pages. As I read about the blog, I came across terms I want to research further this week. Github pages seems like it has some pretty good potential for customization. Moreover, Jekyll and using a static page generator native to Ruby sounds really up my alley! I look forward to learning and playing more with these. If all goes well, this blog will be getting a major facelift shortly.</p>

<p>The final list item, refactoring and beautifying, is my next endeavor. I would very much like to update my portfolio projects to be a bit more enticing to the eyes. I realized a lot of my work was centered around functionality. I am a full stack developer, so I must appeal to the design aesthetics as well. Sure, I know front end languages well enough, but when I apply somewhere: something tells me the resume reviewer is going to take a glance at a site... not test all of its features. Who knows? I'm no recruiter. Either way, with the side work including personal pages and apps, I really should flesh out a prettier portfolio. Thus, I foresee more coffee in the coming days!</p>
