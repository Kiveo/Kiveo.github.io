Memories are pretty much a universally understood thing amongst people. Sessions, cookies, persistent and session based information are not as easily digested. Thus, I endeavor to share my own method of grasping what those more complicated terms really are. 
  Here is how I began to better understand cookies and sessions. For starters, the ground level details of my analogy. Let's imagine I had a camera that both saved a digital image and printed a polaroid.

   Now, let's assume I met someone named Lois Lane at the park. I may remember her name and face for the duration of my picnic at the park. However, it is unlikely I would remember Lois Lane a decade later, even if it was also at the same park. Why? We have lots of reasons, not the least of which is that she might look and be very different. Now, if I took a photo of her and saved the image file's name as Lois Lane, that would help. Let's call my digital photo a *session*. That digital image remains with me, in this example I would be taking the role of the web *server*. The digital photo, *session*, stays with the photographer, the *web server*. 
	 
	Ok, that would help me remember her much better, eliminating my notoriously inaccurate memory. However, it has been ten years! She might have changed quite a bit in that amount of time. Hairstyle, age, weight, complexion, or even her name could have changed. We need something more than a server-side *session*'s photo/memory.
	A solution might be to hand Lois Lane a polaroid duplicate of the photo, after I write down her name and what year it is on the back. Her polaroid copy stays with her, it's her *cookie* to keep or throw away as she desires. Assuming my digital file is time-stamped, like most are, then we both have a representative photo of what she looked like and when we first met. 
	Fast forward a decade later and Lois happens to see me at the park again. She recognizes me because she remembers there was a photographer that gave out free polaroids. As luck would have it, I still do that. So, she comes over and greets me. Naturally, my memory is pretty awful, so she reminds me a bit about when we met and eventually pulls out her polaroid. I see the photo and my handwriting on the back. If I only had my mental memory to work with, I would not have been able to remember her. However, since I have a digital photo with her name and the date listed, I now have my own *session* memory to compare against her *cookie*.
	To further the analogy a tiny bit more, we can say that there is a correlation between time and expiring *cookies*. Had we met up only a couple weeks later, we likely would see nearly identical images (her polaroid/*cookie* and my digital image/*session*). Since it's been ten years however, we notice a lot of differences between the images. Of course, because I recognize her story, the images, and my handwriting, I know it's the same person. That said, we both decide that the old image doesn't represent her as she is now. She also got married and changed her name. So, we agree to take a new photo! She gets a new polaroid/*cookie* and I update my image file/*session* save to represent her new married name, Lois Kent.
	This is the way I envisioned cookies and session memory working. Of course, it's more complicated and the analogy may not do justice for others. However, this perspective worked *super* well for me.
