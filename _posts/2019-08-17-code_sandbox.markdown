There are a lot of tools and apps out there for coding. I still recall using notepad ++ as a great html editor,when I first started coding. Over time, the editors I used became more like full fledged applications. Opening Java's infamous editor, Eclipse, was no joke. It certainly was not a 'simple' app. I eventually fell in love with Atom, only to replace it with my current love: vs code. Regardless, sometimes I don't want an editor. Sometimes I don't want to set up a full environment on whatever pc I am driving. Often, I just need to see if something works,especially when using a tech like ReactJS. I need my own little world to play in the sand. Introducing:  

Codesandbox.io  

A coworker mentioned this to me a couple months back, and I tinkered with it a tiny bit. Even the landing page is impressive. You navigate to the main page, select a framework, such as ReactJS, and BAM! You are directed toa live, auto-refreshing auto-loading auto-magic only in-browser environment of your favorite environment. It'sthat fast and that easy.  

Not impressed? Tell me how long it takes you to npm install a new React project on your machine. Even if you have a super computer, you still need to go through the hassle of the install...heaven forbid you're not on YOUR computer. Imagine borrowing a friend's laptop to test out some code (and yes, nerds really do talk about coding at social gatherings). The laptop doesn't have React installed. Or maybe, they don't have node.js installed. OR maybe they don't know what the word git means.  
  
OK, you get the idea.

So let's talk about what else makes codesandbox so cool. We know it's great for getting up and running RIGHT NOW. What else? List time!

1. Browser based, all you need is internet
2. Connects with github, allowing repos to be edited on the fly
3. Hot reloading: css and code refreshes immediately with changes
4. Sharing, forking, and live viewing 
5. Collabs: edit with others! Interviews, samples, brainstorming...
6. Support for all major JS driven frameworks: React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla =)
7. Supports unit/Jest testing
8. Comprehensive docs, for all the things I mentioned and many I didn't

There's nothing like seeing it yourself. Check out my resource link to codesandbox and go play in the sand yourself, and see why I am so excited about this accessible, powerful, and collaborative tool!
