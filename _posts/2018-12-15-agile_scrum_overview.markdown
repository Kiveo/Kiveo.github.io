In the current era of software development, teams are looking to optimize everywhere. Key terms are flashed around even in job postings for software devs. One of those terms is Scrum. Agile development is a big thing. Let's talk about it!

So, what is Agile and what is Scrum?  
Let's rip through the basics. Agile is a more broad term and Scrum will fall beneath its umbrella. Thus, let's start at the top: Agile.  
Agile development has a notable history and plethora of sources that speak about it. In fact, there is an 'Agile Manifesto' that goes over it in detail (linked in sources).  
I am going to simply and say that the following terms are high level descriptors of Agile development.

1. Methodology: There may be retailers of agile variants, claiming it's a service or product, but it's simply a way of doing something. It's an idea framework for task management. 
2. Iterative: Teams take on bite sized chunks, regroup to review, and repeat for their next bite sized chunk of accomplishment. This contrasts with the 'old waterfall technique'. 
3. Time-chunked: Similar to it's iterative nature, agile development tends to perform dev cycles gated around a time chunk. So, a team may use 2-3 week chunks to accomplish a goal before performing their next iteration. 
4. Adaptive: The methodology relies heavily on effective and consistent communication and collaboration between team members and with the client. 

There are 4 values and 12 principles listed in the manifesto. My list above of 4 key terms is an attempt to consolidate major ideas into a more concise overview of agile. Let's now take a more detailed look into a child of Agile: Scrum.

>AGILE VALUES  
>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
>Working software over comprehensive documentation  
>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
>Responding to change over following a plan

So what is Scrum? 

Scrum Basics
1. Methodology: Even 'official' sources will debate this. Terms like 'process framework' or 'empirical framework' pop up. Flashy words boil down quite well. I'm sure someone will read this and have an eye twitch. My blog, my rules.
2. Iterative: There are 'Sprints' wherein developers attempt to finish enough features to release a deployable product.
3. Time-chunked: Sprints are repeated until a project is finished, but each sprint is gated, usually to a couple weeks.
4. Adaptive: The team not only reviews how a Sprint went, but they also receive feedback or updated requirements from the client routinely.

Ok, I might have used the same key list for Scrum as I did for Agile. We are going to dive into more specifics in just a moment. However, I wanted to highlight that Agile is conceptually no different from Scrum, when stripped down to its core. Think of Scrum as a subclass of Agile. Don't let a tech hiring manager buzzword you into insecurity: If you know Scrum, you know Agile. 

Let's take a two prong approach to getting a feel for Scrum methodology. First, we will go through Scrum terminology. Next, we will provide a simple walkthrough of a dev cycle using Scrum. 

Scrum Specifics
* Roles
  * Product Owner: Responsible for communicating the end goal and key values of the product to the dev team.
  * Scrum Master: Akin to a team lead, the Scrum master acts as liaison between product owner and team.
  * Team: Worker bees! Just kidding. Within Scrum, teams are autonomous in terms of work delegation and include 3-9 specialists.
* Events
  * Sprint: The building block of the iterative production process
    * Sprint Planning: A meeting discussing what work can be accomplished and how it will be done. 
    * Daily Scrum/Standup: Short meeting about how tasks are progressing or if there are complications. 
    * Sprint Review: After a sprint, this meeting demos to the group and product owner prior to production.
    * Sprint Retrospective: Post sprint review to determine areas of improvement for the next cycle. 
* Artifacts
  * Product Backlog: To-do list concerning the product itself, on a big picture scale. This is an evolving document, as new needs arise, they are added to the features list.
  * Sprint Backlog: Those tasks decided on in the planning meeting become the to-do list (backlog).
  * Product Increment: Summation of all completed product backlog tasks... fancy show and tell for to any stakeholders.

Ok, with the terms out of the way, let's walk through them in a sample sequence. A *Product Owner* presents the *product backlog* to the *Scrum master* and *team*. The *team* holds a *sprint planning* meeting and determines what tasks will become the *sprint backlog*. Thenceforth, the *team* splits into self assigned tasks, holding *daily Scrum standup* progress reports until the sprint duration completes. The *Scrum master* has been acting as voice between the *team* and *product owner* meanwhile, in the event one or the other needs to get/give updates about the project... without disturbing the *team*'s productivity. 

After the *sprint*, there is the *sprint review* with the *product owner*. Then, the *sprint retrospective* is held amongst the *team*. Since a *sprint* has been completed, the *product increment* is updated accordingly. This cycle repeats until the final vision is reached or the team loses funding. I suspect it's often both. Regardless of how projects end, each sprint results in a finished product that is releasable. This ensures return on investment, regardless of development phase in a company.    

This wraps up our overview of Scrum, an Agile sub-methodology. 

As always,  
Coffee and Code On!
