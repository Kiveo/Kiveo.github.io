Why? It is the simple question that almost always translates into a long winded response or silence. I am going to take the  first approach. Why? ...

Ok, so why coding? It's easy to say, "It's really fun! I enjoy it tons! It doesn't feel like work and I feel pretty good at it!" That is probably true, on some levels. The reality is, we do things on accident, often. I am a pilot. I am many things, so it irks me to even write that silly 4 word sentence. I am a motorcyclist. I am a swimmer. I am a coder. I am a son. I am more than 3 or 4 words. Anyway, back on track! I flew airplanes for a while. Does ten years count as a while? I think so.
  So after messing around with airplanes for a while, I had some back problems arise. Now THAT is a long story. I will skip to the middle. Amist my back issues, I often found myself laid up in bed or stretched out in some fashion. I began to seek things to occupy my brain. Anything. Everything. I began developing new mental hobbies: browsing art collections, reading online articles, watching shows, playing video games etc. I needed my brain to be occupied. I needed enough static noise to drown out the worries of every tomorrow. 
One day, I decided I wanted to make a website... something super simple but that I could busy myself with. I didn't like the rigidity of the free sites and the cms's like wordpress. Thus, my wife bought me a book. I thought: "When was the last time I even read a book, which wasn't for work?"  It had been a while. So, I started reading.
	We bought another book. Html became css. Css became javascript. JS became php. Php became Java. Java became... "Should I do this?". I liked this. It didn't just drown out the static noise; it was beautiful music for the mind. 
	Suddenly, I found myself coding for fun. Reading for fun. I was...having fun. It was difficult too. It was more than a way to pass the time, it became hope. Not that word you read in novels, and not that word you hear in movies. I mean that feeling you get when it's not a game, it's not a movie...it is your life feeling meaningful and worth engaging in. No more wasting time to pass the time. No more feeling like you can't do anything. In fact, it felt more like "I could do ANYTHING". Hope is powerful.
	Anyway, it transitioned from hobby to practical work alternative. I'll never know how long my back will last me. I have had some procedures done and constantly do forms of physical therapy. Skipping to the end of the back story, I did end up losing my career. I was, however, able to restart it and still work in aviation. Bittersweet reset. That said, I want to do more than fly airplanes now. I want to develop things that will be useful for more than a couple hours. I want to make things that help people. Coding has shown me an entirely new world, behind the scenes of our everyday one. It can make me a paycheck, sure. More importantly, it is fulfilling and engaging. 
	In an effort to summize, I began on accident. I am continuing on purpose.
