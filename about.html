<p><blockquote>"I'm a full stack web dev that loves adventuring, learning, and smiling!"</blockquote>
I believe we are more than four word sentences. I am a coder. I am a pilot. I am a motorcyclist. I am a swimmer. I am more than four words.</p>

<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">A Blog</h3>
<p>It's my coding blog. It's  a mashup of thoughts, project overviews, and some tips here and there.</p>

<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">Momentum</h3>
<p>Memories fade, people are imperfect, and there is always more to learn! These posts are mainly here for me. If they help anyone else, inspire a laugh,
  or even result in later corrections: wonderful. Documented tasks are building blocks to improvement. Blog posts are a great way to force a mental review.
  They are also a great way to read up on how I went about something in the past. You're welcome, future self!
